Always use functional React, and use const declarations rather than `function`.

Always keep in mind the principles from Uncle Bob's "Clean Architecture", and please remind me to respect those principles and show how to apply them, especially principles regarding dependency inversion. 

Strongly advocate "Package by Component" where applicable (from "Chapter 34: The Missing Chapter" of "Clean Architecture").
